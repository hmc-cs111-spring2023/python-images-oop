# Fluency code, Part 3

This code implements an image-processing library, using OOP. The design does not have much
fluency: the end-user must call each method separately.

See [`image.py`](./image.py) for the library and [`program.py`](./program.py) for an
example program that uses the library.

_Note: This code depends on the [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library._
